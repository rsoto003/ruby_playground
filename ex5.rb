#### Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing

my_name = "Ryan Soto"
my_age = 26
my_height = 68
my_weight = 214.6
my_eyes = "Hazel"
my_teeth = "White"
my_hair = "Brown"

puts "Let's talk about #{my_name}."
puts "He's about #{my_height} inches tall."
puts "He's #{my_weight} pounds heavy."
puts "He's actually not too heavy."
puts "He's got #{my_eyes} eyes and #{my_hair} colored hair."
puts "His teeth are usually #{my_teeth} depending on the coffee."

puts "If I add #{my_age}, #{my_height}, and #{my_weight} I get #{my_age + my_height + my_weight}."
