#### Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

#print notifying act of counting chickens
puts "I will now count my chickens"
#prints computations for total number of hens and roosters
puts "Hens #{25.00 + 30.00 /6.00}"
puts "Roosters #{100.00 - 25.00 * 3.00 % 4.00}"
#prints notifying act of counting total number of eggs
puts "Now I will count the eggs:"
#prints total number of eggs
puts 3.00 + 2.00 + 1.00 - 5.00 + 4.00 % 2.00 - 1.00 / 4.00 + 6.00
#prints question asking comparison of two computations, if left side is less than right side
puts "Is it true that 3.00 + 2.00 < 5.00 - 7.00?"
#prints boolean value following computation and evaluation of equations on both sides of comparison operator
puts 3.00 + 2.00 < 5.00 - 7.00
#prints computations that verify the comparison in line 15.
puts "What is 3 + 2? #{3.00 + 2.00}" # The use of #{3 + 2} is how to insert Ruby computations into text strings.
puts "What is 5 - 7? #{5.00 - 7.00}"
#prints comment clarifying the value returned from line 15.
puts "Oh, that's why it's false."
#prints statement to do more computations.
puts "How about some more."
#prints comparison statements similar to line 15, in different comparisons. boolean value is returned to console. 
puts "Is it greater? #{5.00 > -2.00}"
puts "Is it greater or equal? #{5.00 >= -2.00}"
puts "Is it less or equal? #{5.00 <= -2.00}"
